## üéØ Why LearnFlow AI?

LearnFlow AI demonstrates modern AI-driven development practices while solving a real problem: transforming scattered exam questions and handwritten notes into structured, comprehensive study materials.

### Key Features

- **üîÑ LangGraph Workflow Pipeline** - Multi-node processing with configurable HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) capabilities
- **‚úèÔ∏è Interactive Material Editing** - Iterative refinement of synthesized content with fuzzy text matching
- **üõ°Ô∏è LLM Security** - Built-in Guardrails against prompt injection and jailbreak attacks
- **ü§ñ Universal LLM Support** - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API (including local models)
- **üìù OCR & Handwriting Recognition** - Process both typed and handwritten materials
- **üé® Modern Web UI** - React-based interface with real-time updates
- **ü§ñ Telegram Bot** - Conversational interface for on-the-go access
- **üê≥ Docker-First** - One command deployment with `docker compose up`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.13+ (for local development)
- API keys for your chosen LLM provider

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learnflow-ai.git
cd learnflow-ai
```

2. **Configure environment**
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

3. **Start with Docker Compose**
```bash
docker compose up
```

The services will be available at:
- FastAPI: http://localhost:8000
- Web UI: http://localhost:3000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Using Local LLMs

LearnFlow AI supports local LLM providers out of the box:

```bash
# With Ollama
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
MODEL_NAME=llama3

# With LM Studio
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:1234/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=lm-studio
MODEL_NAME=local-model
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

LearnFlow AI uses a modular, event-driven architecture built on LangGraph:

    B --> D[Handwriting Recognition]
    D --> E[Material Synthesis]

    E --> F[Edit Material]
    F --> G[Gap Analysis]
    G --> H[Answer Generation]
    H --> I[Artifacts Storage]

    style F fill:#fcf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Core Components

- **Workflow Engine** - LangGraph-based orchestration with state management
- **Node Architecture** - Modular processing nodes extending `BaseWorkflowNode`
- **Security Layer** - Guardrails for input validation and threat detection
- **Storage Layer** - Thread-based artifact management with GitHub integration
- **Observability** - LangFuse integration for tracing and monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

LearnFlow AI includes comprehensive prompt injection protection:

- **Universal Input Validation** - LLM-based detection with structured output across all entry points
- **Graceful Degradation** - Security never blocks workflow execution, always maintains user experience
- **Fuzzy Content Cleaning** - Smart removal of malicious content while preserving legitimate educational material
- **Educational Context Aware** - Reduces false positives for cryptography and security topics
- **Configuration-Driven** - Security prompts and settings managed through YAML configs
- **Complete Coverage** - Protects exam questions, OCR content, HITL feedback, and edit requests
