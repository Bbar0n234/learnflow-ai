## üéØ Why LearnFlow AI?

LearnFlow AI solves a universal educational problem: transforming scattered educational questions and handwritten notes into structured, comprehensive study materials - from mathematics and physics to literature and history, from elementary school to university level.

### Key Features

- **üîÑ LangGraph Workflow Pipeline** - Multi-node processing with configurable HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) capabilities
- **‚úèÔ∏è Interactive Material Editing** - Iterative refinement of synthesized content with fuzzy text matching
- **üõ°Ô∏è LLM Security** - Built-in Guardrails against prompt injection and jailbreak attacks
- **ü§ñ Universal LLM Support** - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API (including local models)
- **üìù OCR & Handwriting Recognition** - Process both typed and handwritten materials
- **üé® Modern Web UI** - React-based interface with real-time updates
- **ü§ñ Telegram Bot** - Conversational interface for on-the-go access
- **üéØ Personalized Prompts** - Dynamic prompt generation with user-specific configurations
- **üê≥ Docker-First** - One command deployment with `docker compose up`

## üë• Who This Project Is For

### üéì Education and Learning
**Teachers, tutors, instructional designers** ‚Äî automatic generation of educational materials, tests, and gap-analysis questions. The system processes both text queries and handwritten notes, creating personalized learning content.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Developers and Architects
**AI-Driven Development** ‚Äî practical example of delegating code writing to LLM agents while maintaining architectural control. The `docs/` directory contains all project documentation used for effective LLM collaboration.

**Production-ready architecture** based on LangGraph:
- Multi-node agent system with HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)
- Multimodal processing (text + images)
- Microservices: FastAPI, Telegram Bot, external integrations
- Observability via LangFuse
- Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns

The project demonstrates modern approaches to building production-ready AI systems.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.13+ (for local development)
- API keys for your chosen LLM provider

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbaron/learnflow-ai.git
cd learnflow-ai
```

2. **Configure environment**
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

3. **Start with Docker Compose**
```bash
docker compose up
```

The services will be available at:

### Using Local LLMs

LearnFlow AI supports local LLM providers out of the box:

```bash
# With Ollama
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
MODEL_NAME=llama3

# With LM Studio
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:1234/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=lm-studio
MODEL_NAME=local-model
```
