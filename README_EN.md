A universal, LangGraph-based educational content generation system for any subject area and education level. Transform educational questions and handwritten notes into comprehensive study materials with analysis questions and answers.

## üéØ Why LearnFlow AI?

LearnFlow AI solves a universal educational problem: transforming scattered educational questions and handwritten notes into structured, comprehensive study materials - from mathematics and physics to literature and history, from elementary school to university level.

### Key Features

#### For Users (Teachers, Tutors, Instructors, Students)
- **üéØ Exceptional Content Quality** - Advanced prompt engineering techniques with XML structuring and semantic keywords ensure depth and accuracy of generated materials
- **üîß Universal Flexibility** - Adapts to any knowledge domain (from mathematics to literature), audience level (from school to university), material volume, and number of assessment questions
- **üí¨ Convenient Telegram Interface** - Full system functionality through familiar messenger with image support and interactive commands
- **‚úèÔ∏è Interactive Editing** - Iterative material improvement through dialogue with point corrections
- **üìù Handwritten Text Recognition** - Automatic processing of both printed and handwritten notes for creating personalized educational materials

### üìö Examples of Generated Materials

Explore how the system adapts one topic ‚Äî **Qdrant vector database** ‚Äî for different audience levels:

- üü¢ **[Beginner](_examples/beginner/)** ‚Äî Intuitive explanation through analogies. From the semantic search problem to practical application.
- üü° **[Intermediate](_examples/intermediate/)** ‚Äî Architectural understanding: how HNSW works, why exactly this way, performance optimizations.
- üî¥ **[Advanced](_examples/advanced/)** ‚Äî Academic depth: formal definitions, proofs, mathematical apparatus.

Each set: notes ‚Üí material ‚Üí questions ‚Üí answers. This adaptability makes LearnFlow AI universal for any educational context.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- API keys for your chosen LLM provider (see [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick_start.md) for details on obtaining keys)

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bbar0n234/learnflow-ai.git
cd learnflow-ai
```

2. **Configure environment**
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

3. **Start all services**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The services will be available at:
- FastAPI: http://localhost:8000
- Web UI: http://localhost:3001
- LangFuse: http://localhost:3000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Artifacts Service: http://localhost:8001
- Prompt Config Service: http://localhost:8002

### Local Development

1. **Configure local environment**
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys
```

2. **Start all services with one command (recommended)**
```bash
make local-dev
```

This script automatically:
- Installs dependencies via `uv sync`
- Starts PostgreSQL in Docker
- Creates databases and runs migrations
- Starts all services with logging
- Checks health status of each service
- Handles Ctrl+C for graceful shutdown

**Additional commands:**
```bash
./local-reset.sh  # Full environment reset
```

For more details on environment setup, see [docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md)

### Using Local LLMs

LearnFlow AI supports local LLM providers out of the box:

```bash
# With Ollama
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
MODEL_NAME=llama3

# With LM Studio
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:1234/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=lm-studio
MODEL_NAME=local-model
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

LearnFlow AI uses a modular, event-driven architecture built on LangGraph:
