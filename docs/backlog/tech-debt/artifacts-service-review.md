# Artifacts Service Technical Debt

**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days  
**Owner**: TBD  
**Created**: 2025-08-12  

## Overview

Code review of the artifacts service revealed multiple critical security and reliability issues that need to be addressed before production deployment. The service has good architectural foundations but requires significant improvements in authentication, error handling, and thread safety.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Authentication and Authorization
**Severity**: Critical  
**Files**: `artifacts-service/app/main.py` (all endpoints)  
**Issue**: No authentication mechanism exists - any user can access, modify, or delete any files  
**Impact**: Complete security vulnerability in production  
**Effort**: 2 days  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication middleware
- [ ] Add user ownership validation for threads/sessions
- [ ] Create authorization decorators for endpoints
- [ ] Add user management functionality

### 2. Global Mutable State
**Severity**: Critical  
**Files**: `artifacts-service/app/main.py:24`  
**Issue**: Storage instance created as global variable causing race conditions  
**Impact**: State inconsistencies under concurrent access  
**Effort**: 4 hours  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for storage instances
- [ ] Update all endpoints to use injected storage
- [ ] Add proper lifecycle management

### 3. Unsafe Exception Handling
**Severity**: Critical  
**Files**: `artifacts-service/app/main.py:153-154`  
**Issue**: Bare `except:` clauses mask important errors  
**Impact**: Hidden critical errors (permissions, disk space, corruption)  
**Effort**: 2 hours  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace bare except with specific exception handling
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns across service
- [ ] Add proper error logging

### 4. Weak MD5 Hash Usage
**Severity**: Critical  
**Files**: `learnflow/services/artifacts_manager.py:90`  
**Issue**: MD5 used for session ID generation (cryptographically weak)  
**Impact**: Potential session ID collisions, predictable IDs  
**Effort**: 1 hour  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace MD5 with SHA-256 or UUID4
- [ ] Update session ID generation logic
- [ ] Migrate existing session IDs if needed

## Important Issues

### 5. Inconsistent Error Handling
**Severity**: High  
**Files**: Multiple (storage.py, main.py)  
**Issue**: Mixed error handling patterns, inconsistent HTTP responses  
**Impact**: Reduced reliability and debugging capability  
**Effort**: 4 hours  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create standardized exception hierarchy
- [ ] Implement consistent HTTP status code mapping
- [ ] Add error response schemas

### 6. Missing Input Validation
**Severity**: High  
**Files**: `artifacts-service/app/main.py` (file content endpoints)  
**Issue**: File content not validated beyond size limits  
**Impact**: Potential storage of malicious content  
**Effort**: 3 hours  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add content type validation
- [ ] Implement content sanitization
- [ ] Add file format verification

### 7. Thread Safety Concerns
**Severity**: High  
**Files**: `artifacts-service/app/storage.py:335-350`  
**Issue**: Non-atomic metadata updates causing race conditions  
**Impact**: Corrupted metadata under concurrent access  
**Effort**: 6 hours  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement file locking for metadata operations
- [ ] Add atomic transaction support
- [ ] Test concurrent access scenarios

### 8. Duplicate Artifacts Management
**Severity**: Medium  
**Files**: `artifacts-service/` and `learnflow/services/artifacts_manager.py`  
**Issue**: Two overlapping implementations exist  
**Impact**: Code duplication, maintenance burden  
**Effort**: 1 day  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze differences between implementations
- [ ] Choose primary implementation
- [ ] Migrate functionality and remove duplicate
- [ ] Update all references

### 9. Missing Observability
**Severity**: Medium  
**Files**: `artifacts-service/app/main.py`  
**Issue**: No structured logging, metrics, or tracing  
**Impact**: Difficult to monitor and debug in production  
**Effort**: 4 hours  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Implement metrics collection
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Integrate with monitoring systems

### 10. Weak Path Validation
**Severity**: Medium  
**Files**: `artifacts-service/app/storage.py:45-64`  
**Issue**: Path validation could be strengthened  
**Impact**: Potential path traversal attacks  
**Effort**: 2 hours  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Use Path.resolve() for validation
- [ ] Add additional edge case checks
- [ ] Test path traversal scenarios

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1 (Critical Security)**: Authentication, Authorization, Exception Handling
2. **Phase 2 (Reliability)**: Global State, Thread Safety, Error Handling
3. **Phase 3 (Architecture)**: Duplicate Code Consolidation, Input Validation
4. **Phase 4 (Operations)**: Observability, Monitoring, Path Validation

## Dependencies

- Authentication system design decisions
- Database/storage backend choices for user management
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline for testing concurrent scenarios

## Risks

- **High**: Service is completely insecure in current state
- **Medium**: Concurrent usage could cause data corruption
- **Low**: Performance may degrade under load without proper caching

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All endpoints protected by authentication
- [ ] No bare exception handlers remain
- [ ] Thread safety validated through testing
- [ ] Single, consolidated artifacts management implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive observability in place
- [ ] Security audit passes with no critical findings

## Notes

The artifacts service has solid architectural foundations with good use of Pydantic and clean separation of concerns. The main issues are around security and production readiness rather than fundamental design problems.
